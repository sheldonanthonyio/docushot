# Docushot
Docushot is a mobile Android application that lets you turn a PDF file's pages into a collection of images. Whether you need to share a single page or many, Docushot makes it easy and fast. Docushot will convert each page into a high-quality image that you can save, edit, or share with others. Docushot is designed for business people who need a convenient way to extract information from PDF files on the go. With Docushot, you can capture any PDF page as an image in seconds. The app aimed for simple files that constantly need to be reviewed and corrected. The release of drawing notes on those converted images will soon be here :-)
